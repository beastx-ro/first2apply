The tech industry may be fast-paced, but that first interview? Often, it’s more about getting to know you than digging into your code. Many tech job candidates will encounter this first online round as a way for hiring managers to see if you’re a fit both technically and culturally. Here’s how to stand out and make a great impression, with seven practical tips (and a bit of humor) for your next "get-to-know-you" online interview.

## 1. **Test Your Tech, and Then Test It Again**

Nothing says “I’m ready for this job” like getting the tech basics right. We’re in tech, so it’s not just embarrassing if you have mic or camera issues—it’s like showing up to a construction job without a hard hat.

- **Practical tip**: Check your internet speed, headphones, mic, and camera in advance. Most importantly, have a backup plan (your phone hotspot, a spare set of earbuds) in case something goes south.

## 2. **Prepare a Brief, Impactful Introduction**

First impressions are powerful, even online. Your intro should be clear, concise, and give the interviewer a good sense of your tech skills and a sprinkle of personality. This is not the time to read your resume; it’s about storytelling—short and sweet.

- **Practical tip**: Prepare a 1-2 minute “elevator pitch” about your background, key skills, and why you're excited about this role. Keep it fresh, like something you’re excited to share, not like you’re reading from a teleprompter. (No teleprompters allowed!)

## 3. **Do Your Homework on the Company**

A little homework goes a long way. It shows you’re interested and proactive, which every employer loves. Plus, knowing the company’s mission, culture, or tech stack can help you tailor your answers.

- **Practical tip**: Skim their website, read recent blog posts, and check out their latest product news. And if you’re feeling ambitious, take a peek at their GitHub or projects.

## 4. **Show Your Interest with Thoughtful Questions**

The “Do you have any questions for us?” part isn’t just a formality; it’s your time to shine. Thoughtful questions show that you’re truly considering what it would be like to work there and care about making the right choice for your next career move.

- **Practical tip**: Skip the “what’s the salary?” in the first round. Instead, ask about the team’s goals, what success looks like for the role, or how the team handles remote collaboration. And if it’s an early-stage startup, throw in a subtle “how’s funding going?”

## 5. **Let Your Personality Shine, but Keep It Professional**

An online interview can feel formal, but it’s not a court case. It’s okay to be personable and show your quirks—if they’re the right ones. The key is to be yourself while keeping things professional.

- **Practical tip**: Think of it as “work-appropriate you.” Relax, smile, and if the vibe feels right, slip in a light joke or a casual anecdote. But save the stand-up routine for later.

## 6. **Have Examples Ready, and Make Them Relevant**

This is where you can show your expertise in action. When they ask about your experience, be ready with examples that showcase not only your technical skills but also your problem-solving approach.

- **Practical tip**: Prep examples in advance, like how you improved a process, solved a tricky bug, or worked cross-functionally. Think of it as a story: what was the challenge, what did you do, and what was the result?

## 7. **Close Strong with Confidence and Gratitude**

You know how movies sometimes have that _one last line_ before the credits roll? Aim for that. Wrapping up your interview with a confident, memorable close can leave a great impression.

- **Practical tip**: A simple but confident close works wonders. Try: “I’m really excited about the role and feel like I could bring [your skills] to the team. Thanks so much for the time today!” They’ll remember your enthusiasm.

The first round of an interview may seem informal, but it’s critical in setting the tone for all future steps. Show up prepared, be yourself, and don’t be afraid to let your personality shine.
