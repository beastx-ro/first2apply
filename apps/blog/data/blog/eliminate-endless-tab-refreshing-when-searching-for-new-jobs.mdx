## Introduction

In today's fast-paced job market, staying ahead of the competition is crucial.
Yet, for many job seekers, this means keeping an exhausting number of tabs open on their browsers,
each one a different job board or company career page.
The ritual is familiar: open, refresh, scan, and repeat, in the hopes that a new listing might have appeared.
This method is not only time-consuming but incredibly inefficient, leading to frustration and, quite possibly, missed opportunities.

### The Challenge of Manual Job Searching

Imagine you're searching for a new position.
You have your favorite job boards and a few company pages that you're eyeing.
To stay updated, you find yourself juggling between 5 to 10 open tabs, if not more, constantly refreshing them to catch the latest postings.
This approach is fraught with challenges:

- **Time Consumption**: Each refresh eats into your day, time that could be spent tailoring resumes, networking, or even taking a well-deserved break.
- **Overwhelming Information**: Keeping track of which tabs have been refreshed, which jobs you've already viewed, and where you saw them can quickly become overwhelming.
- **Missed Opportunities**: In the hustle of refreshing and toggling between tabs, it's easy to overlook new postings, especially on high-traffic boards where listings quickly get buried.
